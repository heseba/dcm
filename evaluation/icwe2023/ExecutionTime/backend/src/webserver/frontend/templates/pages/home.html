        Due to Go <code>.Int()</code> conversion from the

        when returning from WASM.<br />
        After the JavaScript maximum safe integer
        <code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code> (2<sup>53</sup> - 1), the results
        from WASM are incorrect. (79th array position and above)

        By pressing the button a fibonacci calculation will be triggered for a
        JavaScript implementation and for a Go in WASM implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The execution is fast in both implementations. The calculations are
        predictable because there aren't alot of variations. Most of it can be
        cached.

        By pressing the button a fibonacci calculation will be triggered
        <b>1.000 times</b> for a JavaScript implementation and for a Go in WASM
        implementation.<br />The executions happen independently. First
        JavaScript 1000x, then WASM 1000x.<br />Due to Go's limited int64
        implementation the number of elements shouldn't go above the int64
        range.

        <summary>Video about why Promise.all is slower.</summary>
        <p>
          The video shows that <code>Promise.all</code> is slower because it
          queues the tasks in chunks. This is due to the implementation of the
          WebWorker pool since only a maximum amount of WebWorkers are allowed
          to run in parallel. Since the are queued at the same time, all other
          available tasks have to wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          The for loop on the other hand is faster because if the first
          WebWorker finishes quick enough, it can handle the next task right
          after its execution.

      The results show that JavaScript has the native language advantage in
      terms of execution speed. It takes quite some time to call and execute a
      WASM file.<br />

      <h2>Multiple iterations of find nth prime number</h2>
      <p>
        By pressing the button a calculation of prime numbers will be triggered
        <b>50 times</b> until the 500.000th prime number each iteration was
        found. <br />The executions happen simultaneously. Each iteration both
        functions are running until both finished. Then they go into the next
        iteration.<br />
        Calling WASM files in a loop can be a downside. When moving the
        iteration inside the WASM container, it improves the execution speed.
